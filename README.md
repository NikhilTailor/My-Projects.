# My-Projects.
Its my first repository and here I will upload my projects.
My projects details are given below:

1. Periodic Table:- This project I desinged to help the competitive students of JEE and NEET. In this project you have to just give the input of
atomic number of the particular element and the details of that element will be displayed over your screen. The details which will be shown are =
* Element's name and it's symbol
* Atomic mass
* Electronic configuration
* Valency
* Position in the periodic table

2. Dimensions:- This projects also relates to JEE and NEET aspirants.In this I coded 50 dimensional formulas.(Dimension mean writing any formula in 
the form of mass ,length and time.) When you run the program it will show you 50 formulas with their assigned numbers , just write any number out of them
of which you want the dimension , and then the program will display you the dimension of that particular formula.
