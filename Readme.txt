Welcome the Periodic Table.

In this software the program takes the input from the user of atomic nnumber from 1 to 118,
and displays the information of the following data:-

*Name of the element with its symbol
*Atomic mass
*Valency
*Electronic configuration
*Position in the periodic table.

When you are done with the searching of a data , the program will ask for whether you want to
find more or not, then press either 'y' or 'n'.
If pressed 'y', the program will run further again and if pressed 'n', the program will exit
and the console will end automatically...
